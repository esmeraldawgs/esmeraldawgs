### My experience :office:
My journey into Quality Assurance began with an internship at Indomaret Group, where I was introduced to the fundamentals of QA practices. During this period, I gained essential experience in software testing, including designing test plans, scenarios, and procedures.

At PT Indomarco Prismatama, I further honed my QA skills by creating and managing test cases for two products with three user roles, totaling over 150 test cases. I played a key role in analyzing test results and reporting findings to the development team. Collaborating closely with developers to address and resolve bugs deepened my understanding of both manual and automated testing processes.

Currently, I am working as a Software Quality Assurance at Mostrans. In this role, I perform both manual and automation testing using Selenium with Python, WebDriverIO and Cypress with JavaScript. I create comprehensive technical documentation to guide users and internal teams, and monitor and test API functionality with Postman.

These experiences have significantly enhanced my technical and analytical skills and have fueled my passion for QA. I am now eager to continue growing in this field, particularly in test automation, to further refine my expertise and contribute effectively to the quality of digital products.

This project was built as part of the Project-Based Virtual Internship by Bank Mandiri x Rakamin Academy.
The main task was to develop a news application using Jetpack Compose with infinite scroll functionality.
In addition to completing the main requirement, I took the initiative to:
- üîç Add a real-time search bar to filter news dynamically.
- üîÑ Add a refresh button that scrolls back to the top and reloads the latest news data.
